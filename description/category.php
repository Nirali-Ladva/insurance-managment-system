Developing the IHP
Speak with your child’s health care provider(s) about your child’s school experiences and the potential threats to their health in the school environment
Seek information from your child’s health care provider(s) about your child’s specialized needs in the school environment
Request that your child’s health care provider(s) document your child’s needs and necessary supports, services, etc. in writing to share with the school
Request a meeting with your child’s school to discuss development of an Individualized Health Plan
Special Education:
If your child is receiving special education services, incorporate the information relating to the IHP into the IEP meeting
Request that the IHP services be included as part of the IEP
Ensure that the IHP section of the IEP be shared with all relevant staff & administrators
If your child is not currently receiving special education services, consider whether your child may be eligible for special education services (for example, Other Health Impaired; Physical Disability)
If appropriate, request an evaluation for special education services. Ensure that your child’s health issues are evaluated.
Section 504:
If your child’s special health care needs significantly impact your child’s daily activities (learning, breathing, seeing, walking, etc.) in the school environment, request a Section 504 evaluation
Meet with the 504 team to share information on your child’s special health care needs & develop a Section 504 plan that incorporates an IHP
Developing the IHP, continued
Other:
If your child’s special health care needs do not require special education or a Section 504 plan, ask to meet with the appropriate school or district staff to discuss an IHP
Share the information from your child’s health care provider(s)
Identify key times of day, activities, places, etc. that require special attention
Developing the IHP, continued
Develop the IHP containing:

Developing the IHP, continued
Identification of parties responsible to provide services, supports, etc.
