Why do I Need Student Travel Insurance? 
	Studying abroad in a foreign land entails a lot of risk. Medical expenses in foreign currency and hospitalization can be prohibitively expensive. A student living alone outside India might also need visits from family or other back-ups if something goes wrong. Our travel policy covers you for all such eventualities for just a fraction of the amount you would otherwise need.

 Covers expenses of hospitalization, loss of baggage, accident to sponsor, family visit and other     incidental expenses
